# Cohort Analysis in R

This repository contains how to perform and visualize cohort analysis in R.

The dataset used can be found in [ethen8181/machine-learning repo](https://github.com/ethen8181/machine-learning/blob/master/python/cohort/relay-foods.csv).

If you succeed replicating the code, you should end up with the following plot.
